The IExtensionHost interface is used to provide a host for extensions in the Command Palette. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of extensions, including loading and unloading them, as well as providing access to shared resources and services.

This is an object which extensions shouldn't implement themselves. Rather, this is implemented by the host app itself.
