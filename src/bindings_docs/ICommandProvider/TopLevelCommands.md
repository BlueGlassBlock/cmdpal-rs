These are the commands that will allow the user to interact with the rest of your extension. They can be simple actions, or they can be pages that the user can navigate to.

## Returns
An [`ICommandItem`] array that contains the commands that should be shown in the Command Palette. The commands will be displayed in the order that they are returned by this method.
